# Quality Requirements

## Scalability and Performance

Scalability and performance go hand-in-hand in this system. Disputes are common occurrences and it is expected that the Dispute Resolution Engine (DRE) must be capable of handling many cases simultaneously, as well as multiple active users, per case, at any given time. Performance is essential for scalability. A system that performs well for each user can scale more effectively.

## Usability

The Dispute Resolution Engine is designed to be user-friendly. It aims to enable easy navigation through simple and intuitive user interfaces. This ensures that users can operate the system effectively without extensive training or technical knowledge. This is crucial for a platform that is intended to accommodate users from a wide range of domains.

## Reliability

The Dispute Resolution Engine must maintain high uptime due to the nature of the services we provide. Clients should have access to the system at all times. A reliable system with high uptime not only benefits our clients but also increases our throughput.

## Security

The Dispute Resolution Engine often handles sensitive information, not only from user accounts but also from the parties involved in disputes. This may include evidence documents containing potentially exploitable information. Therefore, a fundamental requirement of the Dispute Resolution Engine is to ensure the protection of both personal and corporate information of our clients.
