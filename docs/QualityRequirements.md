# Quality Requirements
## Scalability and Performance
Scalability and performance fall hand in hand for this system. In the real-world, disputes are not uncommon and it is expected that the Dispute Resolution Engine (DRE) will have to be capable of handling many cases at once, as well as many active users at once. Performance is important for scalability as the better the system performs on a per-user basis, the better its ability to scale naturally. 
## Usability
## Reliability
## Security
The Dispute Resolution Engine often handles sensitive information, not only from user accounts but also from the parties involved in disputes. This may include evidence documents containing potentially exploitable information. Therefore, a fundamental requirement of the Dispute Resolution Engine is to ensure the protection of both personal and corporate information of our clients.
