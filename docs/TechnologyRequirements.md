## Next.js
Next.js allows for serverless functioning, which makes the platform easily scalable and performant. 
The versatility of the framework further provides the capability to easily integrate modules and 
components, while still keeping a focus on the platforms usability. It also naturally integrates 
cross-device display for the site application.

## ShadCn and Tailwind
The combination of Shadcn, a component library, and Tailwind, a styling library, makes for a neat 
and professional frontend look, which compliments the platforms usability.

## GoLang
GoLang will be used for most of the implementations of communications between components. GoLang 
was designed to be highly performant, scalable and reliable.

## Postgres
PostgreSQL is an ideal choice for our dispute resolution engine due to its advanced features, robustness,
and security capabilities. Its parallel query execution ensures enhanced performance and scalability, 
allowing the system to handle high traffic and complex queries efficiently. The row-level security (RLS)
feature provides fine-grained access control, ensuring that sensitive information is only accessible to 
authorized users, thereby enhancing compliance with privacy regulations. PostgreSQL's support for JSON 
and JSONB data types allows flexible handling of complex and hierarchical data, facilitating efficient 
storage and querying of dispute-related information. Additionally, its full-text search capabilities enable 
quick and accurate retrieval of relevant disputes, legal documents, and case notes, significantly 
improving user experience.
