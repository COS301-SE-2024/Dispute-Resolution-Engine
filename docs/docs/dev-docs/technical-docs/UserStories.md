# User Stories

Some users of the system will be known as _concerned parties_. These concerned parties have very similar needs, however they may fall into two main categories depending on how a dispute is initiated:

- **Complainants:** Users that wish to initiate a dispute process with another user
- **Respondants:** Users with whom a dispute process has been initiated by a complainant

It is worth noting that _concerned parties_ only refer to complainants and respondents, i.e. they do not include the other user types detailed below.
