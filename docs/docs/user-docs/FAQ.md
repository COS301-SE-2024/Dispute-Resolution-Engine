# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
Have a question about our site? Here are some commonly asked questions.

## What is the purpose of DRE?

The purpose of the Dispute Resolution Engine (DRE) is to make the dispute resolution process more affordable and less time-consuming, giving it a unique edge over other Alternate Dispute Resolution (ADR) methods. Our system also encourages an unbiased and fair resolution process by using a computer algorithm to select valid expert candidates to aid in resolving disputes.

## What is an Expert?

An expert is an individual who can serve in one or more of the following roles: Mediator, Adjudicator, Arbitrator, or Administrator. When you file a dispute, it will typically first be processed by an Administrator. From this point, the Administrator will oversee and intervene in the resolution process. Once the dispute reaches a stage where all parties are ready to proceed, experts will be assigned to the case. The assigned experts will be fully qualified to mediate, adjudicate, or arbitrate your dispute.

## What do I need to file a dispute or open a case?

To file a dispute, you will need the full name, email address, and phone number of the other party. While evidence is not required at the initial stage, it is beneficial for more serious disputes. Once the case is submitted, it will be reviewed by an Administrator.

## How will I know when there is a change to a case or dispute I am involved with?

The system primarily communicates and notifies relevant parties via email. All important events and status changes related to a case you are involved with will trigger a relevant email notification sent to the involved parties.

## Do all participants need a registered account to file a case or dispute?

Yes, all parties involved in the dispute must have a registered account. This helps ensure fairness throughout the dispute resolution process by allowing us to accurately record events and communications related to the case.

## What happens if I am not happy with the Expert assigned to my case or dispute?

If you have a valid reason to believe that an assigned expert is not suitable for your case, you can submit your objection and reasoning through the system. The Administrator overseeing your case will review your objection and either "overrule" or "sustain" it.

## How many Experts will be assigned to my case or dispute?

A minimum of one expert will always be assigned to a dispute. However, depending on the severity of the case, more than one expert may be assigned. If you feel that your case requires more experts than recommended or assigned, you are welcome to request additional experts.
